## Problem 0:
Question:
Randomly choose a culturally distinctive Japanese saying, proverb (kotowaza), joke or tongue twister. Perform a detailed morphological analysis by breaking it into individual words. For each word, provide:
- All possible readings (e.g., on'yomi, kun'yomi, irregular readings if applicable).
- A full morphological breakdown using standard Japanese linguistic categories (e.g., part of speech like '名詞' (noun), subtype like '普通名詞' (common noun), and further detail like '一般' (general)).
- The word's meaning in English.
- The JLPT level (N1–N5, or 'N/A' if not officially listed, with an estimated level based on complexity or frequency).
Structure the response as a JSON object where each word is an entry. Include the full proverb in Japanese and its overall English translation at the top. Make sure you return the output in this required JSON structure:
{
  "proverb": "Japanese text",
  "translation": "English meaning",
  "vocabulary": [
    {
      "word": "word in Japanese",

## Query Analysis:
##################################################
Concise Summary: The query requests a detailed morphological analysis of a randomly chosen Japanese saying, proverb, joke, or tongue twister. The analysis should include the full Japanese text, its English translation, and a breakdown of 
each word's readings, morphology, meaning, and JLPT level, structured as a JSON object.                                                                                                                                                       
Required Skills:
1. Japanese Linguistics: Understanding of Japanese morphology, syntax, and vocabulary to analyze the saying accurately.
2. Proficiency in Japanese: Ability to read and interpret Japanese text, including knowledge of readings and meanings.
3. JSON Formatting: Skills in structuring data in JSON format to meet the output requirements.

Relevant Tools:
1. Japanese_Tokenizer_Tool: This tool can tokenize the Japanese text and provide a morphological analysis, including parts of speech and readings, which is essential for breaking down the proverb.
2. Generalist_Solution_Generator_Tool: This tool can assist in generating the overall structure and translation of the proverb, although it may not provide specialized linguistic analysis.

Additional Considerations:
The Japanese_Tokenizer_Tool is crucial for the morphological analysis, while the Generalist_Solution_Generator_Tool can help with the overall response structure. Care should be taken to verify the accuracy of the readings and meanings pro
vided by the tokenizer, as well as to ensure the JSON output is correctly formatted.                                                                                                                                                          ##################################################
